<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Swine Influenza Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Live Vaccines</li><li>Killed Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The swine influenza vaccines market consists of primarily two types: live vaccines and killed vaccines. Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus, stimulating an immune response without causing disease, providing longer-lasting immunity. Killed vaccines, on the other hand, contain inactivated virus particles, which elicit an immune response without the risk of infection, though they may require boosters for prolonged protection. Both vaccine types are essential in controlling outbreaks and improving swine herd health in the livestock industry.</p></p>
