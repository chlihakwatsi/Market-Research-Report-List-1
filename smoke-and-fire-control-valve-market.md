<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smoke and Fire Control Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity</li><li>Spring</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The smoke and fire control valve market encompasses two primary types: gravity and spring valves. Gravity valves operate based on the force of gravity, closing automatically when there is no airflow, effectively blocking smoke and fire. In contrast, spring valves utilize a spring mechanism to remain closed under normal conditions and open when activated by fire detection systems. Both types play crucial roles in fire protection strategies, ensuring smoke containment and facilitating safe evacuation routes during emergencies.</p></p>
