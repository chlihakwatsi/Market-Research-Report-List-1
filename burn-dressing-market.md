<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Burn Dressing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-Resistant</li><li>Normal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Burn dressing can be categorized into two main types: water-resistant and normal. Water-resistant burn dressings are designed to provide an additional barrier against moisture, making them ideal for use in wet environments or when exposed to water. They help maintain wound moisture while preventing infection. Normal burn dressings, on the other hand, are typically absorbent and suitable for everyday use in dry conditions.
